# "Connecting the Dots"

## INTRODUCTION

This Project is born from real life situation: I was looking at a job ad regarding Websites content manager for a hotel chain, and I found myself in front of a conundrum about my less than orthodox career path - combining hotel sales managment, artistic endeavours and development. I made my considerations and concluded that there was no way that I would manage to make any recruiter believe in me if they saw a résumé with all that missmatched information. 

When struggling with the conundrum, I thought that should I manage to get the first interview, at any critical point I could take out my tablet and let the interviewer browse a single screen presentation in html with different contents: information of curriculum vitae, GitHub repositories, moodboards of my marketing vision, even artistic demos. This would offer them a well mapped path to see the ways I could become an asset for them, by letting them choose the elements of interest. In a nutshell, let them connect the dots to their convenience.

To not become a one-off thing, the interface should be adaptable to different position applied (since the experience would always remain the same) and adjustable in a couple of inconspicuous moves after reading the room. 

After thinking the idea further, I considered that the connection might even be a three-way communication if behind the lead for the job were an impresario or an agent. Let's take as example the situation where an impesario sends a performing artist for an audition with a producer.

The impresario probably knows the producer better than the artist does, and knows what the producer is expecting to see and which kind of content could make a difference between their client and others. The impresario also knows their artist, what aspect of the experience to pitch and which ones to hide.

Instead of providing a hardcopy portfolio to the artist to complement the audition, the impresario can set up a single screen presentation, picking the content to display as well as the possible parallel, secondary path which may be of interest in the specific production. For instance an actor could have had a previous experience as dancer or on the catwalk, which might be an asset for the production. An Only-Fans profile for foot fetish could instead be something to brush under the carpet in that production.

The UI of the presentation has a number of preset options depending of the concrete situation of the audition - a creative general mood might invite for a unicorn-based theme, whereas if the circumstances were tense, the artist possibly would want to discreetly change the theme.

In this case the user would theoretically be 3: the impresario - Admin, the artist - the interviewee and the producer - the interviewer or end user. The support should be mandatorily chosen and approved by the Admin, and preferably have a touchscreen to avoid messing up with displays, keyboards and mice. The information provided should be succinct and not lag due to the need of connection to a database.

The end product by connecting the dots and heterogeneous content would be a portable portfolio/demo/moodboard.

## UX and UI

The user experience is expected to be highly different, whether the user is Admin or interviewee/interviewee. 

The interviewee's intervention is expected to be merely accessory: if necessary, quick-adjust the UI for the interviewer and hand over the device.

The device should preferably be a portable handheld device with a touch-screen. The end-use, i.e. the interviewer's actions are limited to standard browsing gesture and possibly bookmarking or sharing content.

The administrator however will do the lionshare of the setting up of the device, using most of the features.

### GitHub profiles

Due to occasional issues with the IDE on my Desktop computer, I have used my secondary GitHub profile, PedroSv-bit for most of the development. The main repository is hosted on my Code Institute related profile.
